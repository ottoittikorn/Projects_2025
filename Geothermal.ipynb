    "Quantitatively evaluate the economic prospects of geothermal power for the UK by forecasting future **Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE)** for geothermal, comparing it to other power sources (e.g. wind, solar, nuclear), and assessing whether geothermal deployment at scale is economically and technically feasible in the UK.\n",

    "Questions/Problems:\n",
    "- How will geothermal LCOE evolve over the next 10â€“30 years under plausible scenarios?\n",
    "- When (if at all) might geothermal reach grid parity versus alternatives in the UK?\n",
    "- What is the financial viability (NPV / IRR) of a representative UK geothermal plant under different cost scenarios?"
